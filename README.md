# Windows Text Rendering Profiler

I wrote this tool due to a bug I discovered in the Windows 10 creators edition release which causes a massive (x20-x50) slowdown in text rendering when using the ExtTextOutW or DrawTextExW WinAPI functions.

I created a stack exchange discussion to see if there's a work-around for this issue:
